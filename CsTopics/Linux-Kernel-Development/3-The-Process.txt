| 3: The Process |
------------------
---------------------
---- The Process ----
---------------------
- process: an instance of an executing program/program in the midst of execution
  - set of resources. program code, open files, pending signals, state, addr space, threads, ...
  - "living result of running program code"
- theads: objects of activity within a process
  - program counter, process stack, process registers
- kernel schedules individual threads, not processes
  - linux does not differentiate between threads and processes, "thread is just a special kind of process"
- proceses can consist of multiple threads (multithreaded)
- processes provide two virtualizations
  - virtualized processor: illusion that process has sole access/monopolizes system
  - virtual memory: process allocate and memory as if it has access to the entire system
- threads share the virtual memory abstraction but receives own virtualized processor
- program != process. process is active program and related resources
- fork() created new child process, exact cloen of parent
  - fork() returns twice, once for parent and once for child
  - can then call exec() to create new address space and load program into it
  - fork() actually implemented via clone()
  - exit() sys call used to exit a program, terminate process and free all resources


---------------------------------------------------
---- Process Descriptor and the Task Structure ----
---------------------------------------------------
- kernel stores list of processes in circular doubly linked list called "task_list"
- links are maintained in the "tasks" field
- each element in task list is a process descriptor of type "struct task_struct", 1.7 kilobytes
  - both threads and and processes are represented via the task_struct, "everything is a process" model
  - contains all the information about the specific process


---- Allocating the process descriptor ----
-------------------------------------------
- "task_struct" allocated via slab allocator, provides object reuse and cache coloring
- "thread_info" is the first element of the task struct
  - contains pointer back to the "task_struct"


---- Storing the Process Descriptor ----
----------------------------------------
- system identifies processes by unique processor identification value (PID)
- numerical value represented by pit_t (int)
- tasks typically referenced directly by pointer to their task_struct
- thread group ID (tgid): logically group threads into processes
  - all threads in a process have the same tgid, equal to pid of processes main thread
  - each thread has a unique pid
  -  if pid == tgid, main thread of process
- current macro used for getting task_strut of currently executing process
- tasks typeically referenced direclty via pointer ot their task_struct


---- Process State ----
-----------------------
- state field described current condition of the process
- 1 of 5 different states
  - TASK_RUNNING: runnable, currently running/on a run queue waiting to run
    - only possible state for a process executing in user space
  - TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping, waiting for some condition to exist
    - set to TASK_RUNNING when condition occurs
  - TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: identical to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE except it does not wake up and become
    runnable if it receives a signal
  - __TASK_TRACED: process is being traaced by another process
  - __TASK_STOPPED: process execution has stopped, not running nor eligible to run


---- Manipulting the current process state ----
-----------------------------------------------
- change state via "set_task_state(task, state)"
  - also equivalent to task->state = state


---- Process Context ----
-------------------------
- one of most important parts of process is executing program code
  - code read in from executable file, executed in the programs addr space
- normal program execution in user space
- execute sys call to ender into kernel state which executes in a process context

---- Process Family Tree ----
-----------------------------
- all processes are descendants of the init process, PID == 1
  - init started in the last step of the boot process
- every process has exactly one parent and zero or more children
- each "task_struct" has pointer to parents "task_struct", called 'parent'
  - also list of children called 'children'

---- Chapter Writeup ----
-------------------------
A process is a key component of an opearting system. It can be roughly defined as an instance of an executing
program and all related resources. One key mistake is that people make a 1 to 1 associated between a process and a
program. In reality, a process contains not only the program code that does get executed, but it also contains information
aobut things such as open files, pending signals, state, the address space, threads, and so on. We can now introduce threads.
Threads are simply objects of activity within a process. They contain state such as a program counter, process stack, and process registers.
It is key to note that the kernel does not schedule processes, it schedules threads!. It does not differentiate between a process and a thread.
To the kernel, a thread is just a special kidn of process. Processes used to be just associated with a single threads, but with the rise 
of multithreading processes are often associated with multiple threads. The processor provides two virtualizations. One is a virtual processor and 
the other is virtual memory. Virtualized processor gives each thread the illusion that it has sole access to all computing resources on the system
and virtual memory gives it the illusion that it has a monopoloy on all the memory in the system. Threads will share the virtual memory, but
they each get their own virtual processor. 

The kernel maintains all tasks in a circular doubly linked list. This list is comprised of structs of the type "task_struct". Each element
is a process descriptor that contains all the information needed about a specific process. These are allocated via a slab allocator that provides
object reuse and cache coloring. Each process here can be uniquily identified via a process identification number (PID).
