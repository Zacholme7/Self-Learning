9.1: Creating a REST API with aiohttp
----------------------
- REST: representational state transfer
    - key concept is a resource -> anything that can be represented by a noun
- aiohttp provides webserver functionality through the web module
- can then define routes with a RouteTableDef
    - has decorator that lets us specify the request
- aiohttp application class acts as a dictionary
- every request that our route gets will have a reference to the application instance through the app field
- signal handler oon application to handle setup tasks
- can parameterize routes and get the value through the reuqest.match_info dictionary

9.2: The asynchronous server gateway interface
----------------------
- WGSI is a standardized way to forward web request to a web framework 
    - not designed to support asyncrhonous workloads
- ASGI was created to fill this purpose
    - has three params: scope dictionary, receive coroutine, and send coroutine
    - can run with uvicorn to serve it

9.3: ASGI with Starlette
----------------------
- starlette is a small asgi compliant framework
- startlette class takes the following parametres
    -list of route object and a list of routines to run on startup and shutdown
- can use WebSocketEndpoint in starlette to create a websocket
    - need to implement on_connect endpoint, on_recieve endpoint, and on_disconnect endpoint
