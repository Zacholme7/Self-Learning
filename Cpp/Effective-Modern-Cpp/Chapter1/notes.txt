1: Deducing types
---------------------------------
- function templates were introducted in c++98
- c++11 expanded upton this and added "auto" and "decltype"
- type deduction makes it so you dont have to spell out types that are obvious or redundant

Item 1: Understanding template type deduction
---------------------------------
#1
- compilers use expr to deduce two types
        - one for T in the template and one for ParamType
        - often different because ParamType often has adornments such as const
- the type deduced for T is dependent not just on the type of expr, but also on the form of ParamType
# Case 1: ParamType is a reference or pointer, but not a universal reference
        - in this situation, type deduction is the following
        1: If exprs type is a reference, ignore the reference part
        2: then pattern match exprs type against ParamType to determine T
        - cx and rx are const values, so T is also a const int and param is const int &
        - for rx, even though rx is a ref T is deduced to be a non reference (referenceness ignored during type deduction)
# Case 2: ParamType is a Universal Reference
        - if expr is lvalue, both T and ParamType deduced to be lvalue references
                - only situation where T deduced to be a reference
        - if expr is rvalue, case 1 rules apply
        - type deduction rules for universal ref params are differenet from those for params that are lvalue ref or rval ref
# Case 3: ParamType is neither a pointer nor a reference
        - dealing with pass by value here
        1: if expr type is reference, ignore the reference part
        2: after ignoring refness, if expir is const ignore that too
