// What is a type system?
// - formal static analysis technique which is auto applied
// to your program to verify aspects of its behavior
// 1) Satefy properties
// - guarantees that "bad things dont happen"
// Ex: Fn(String) -> Int. Can only be called with string
// 2) liveness properties
// - gurantees that "good things do happen"
// Ex: Fn(String) -> Int. Will always return an int

// ownership is method of extending type system so it can be used to
// establish additional guarantees about safety/liveness properties

fn main() {
